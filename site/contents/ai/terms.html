<h1 id="artificial-intelligence-ai-terms">Artificial Intelligence (AI) terms</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI-Powered Assistant</strong>: An AI-powered assistant is a virtual assistant that uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to understand and respond to user requests. AI-powered assistants can be used to perform tasks such as scheduling appointments, setting reminders, providing information, and answering questions.</li>
<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>: Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, perception, and problem-solving.</li>
<li><strong>Chatbot</strong>: A chatbot is an AI-powered computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, typically through text messages or voice interactions. Chatbots can be used for customer service, sales, marketing, and other applications.</li>
<li><strong>Computer Vision</strong>: Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual data from the world around them, such as images and videos.</li>
<li><strong>Computer Vision System</strong>: A computer vision system is an AI-powered system that uses computer vision algorithms to interpret and understand visual data from the world around it. Computer vision systems can be used for applications such as object detection, face recognition, and image classification.</li>
<li><strong>Decision Tree</strong>: A decision tree is a graphical representation of a decision-making process that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. Decision trees are often used in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.</li>
<li><strong>Deep Learning</strong>: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks with large amounts of data to perform complex tasks, such as image and speech recognition.</li>
<li><strong>Expert System</strong>: An expert system is an AI-powered system that uses a knowledge base and reasoning algorithms to simulate the decision-making abilities of a human expert in a particular domain.</li>
<li><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training computer programs to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks over time, without being explicitly programmed to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Narrow AI</strong>: Narrow AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks, rather than exhibiting general intelligence.</li>
<li><strong>Natural Language Generation</strong>: Natural Language Generation is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on using machine learning algorithms to automatically generate natural language text from structured data or other sources.</li>
<li><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>: Natural Language Processing is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.</li>
<li><strong>Neural Network</strong>: A neural network is a type of artificial intelligence algorithm that is modeled after the structure and function of the human brain. Neural networks are often used in deep learning applications.</li>
<li><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that involves training an algorithm to make decisions based on feedback it receives from its environment.</li>
<li><strong>Supervised Learning</strong>: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning that involves training an algorithm using labeled data, where the desired output is known.</li>
<li><strong>Training Data</strong>: Training data is a set of data used to train machine learning algorithms. Training data typically consists of input data and corresponding output data, which is used to teach the algorithm how to make predictions.</li>
<li><strong>Turing Test</strong>: The Turing Test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.</li>
<li><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>: Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that involves training an algorithm using unlabeled data, where the desired output is unknown. The algorithm must find patterns and relationships in the data on its own.</li>
