## What is Creative Commons?
Creative Commons (CC) is a system that allows creators to share their work with others while keeping some rights. It provides different types of licenses to control how a work can be used, modified, and shared.

## Types of Creative Commons Licenses
There are six main types of Creative Commons licenses. Each has different rules about how the work can be used.

### 1. **CC BY (Attribution)**
