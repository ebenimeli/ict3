# Project: Researching an Advanced Robot with AI and Sensor Technologies

In this activity, you will work in pairs to research a specific advanced robot that heavily incorporates Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sensor technologies. You will gather information about the robot’s AI systems and sensors, and create a presentation to share with the class.

## Part 1: Choosing a Robot

Begin by discussing advanced robots with your partner. Choose a robot that utilizes both AI techniques and sensors for interaction. Focus on robots that demonstrate innovative uses of sensor data and AI-driven decision-making. Try to choose a robot that you find interesting or aligns with your personal interests.

## Part 2: Researching the Robot

Use reliable sources such as academic journals, reputable websites, and news articles to gather information on the robot you have chosen.

You should gather detailed information on the following aspects:

- **Purpose**: What tasks or problems is the robot designed to address? How does it use AI to fulfill these tasks?
- **Design**: What does the robot look like? What are the key components, especially its sensors and AI systems?
- **Sensors**: Focus on the sensors the robot uses to interact with its environment. How do these sensors collect data, and how does AI process this information to guide the robot’s actions?
- **AI Systems**: What type of AI is integrated into the robot (e.g., machine learning, expert systems)? How does the AI help the robot make decisions based on sensor input?
- **Actuators**: What actuators does the robot use for movement or interaction, and how are they controlled by AI systems?
- **Innovations**: What sets this robot apart in terms of its AI capabilities and sensor usage? How do these innovations improve the robot’s functionality?
- **Applications**: What are some potential applications of this robot in real-world scenarios? How could its AI and sensor technologies be applied in various industries or everyday situations?

## Part 3: Creating a Presentation

Create a PowerPoint presentation to share your research with the class.

Your presentation should include the following:

- **Introduction**: Introduce the robot and explain why you chose it, highlighting its AI and sensor technologies.
- **Purpose**: Describe what the robot is designed to do and how AI and sensors play a role in its function.
- **Design**: Share images and descriptions of the robot’s components, focusing on the sensors and AI systems.
- **Sensors**: Explain the types of sensors the robot uses, how they work, and how AI processes sensor data to inform actions.
- **AI Systems**: Describe the AI techniques the robot uses (e.g., machine learning, neural networks) and how they contribute to decision-making.
- **Actuators**: Discuss the actuators the robot uses and how AI controls them to execute tasks.
- **Innovations**: Highlight what makes the robot’s AI and sensor integration advanced and innovative.
- **Applications**: Share some potential real-world applications for the robot, emphasizing how its AI and sensors can be utilized.
- **Conclusion**: Summarize the key points and explain why this robot’s AI and sensor technologies make it significant.

## Part 4: Presenting to the Class

Present your research to the class, using your PowerPoint presentation. Be prepared to answer questions about the AI and sensor technologies your robot uses.

This project will help you explore the role of AI and sensors in advanced robotics while developing your research, critical thinking, and presentation skills. Have fun!
