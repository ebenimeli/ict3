# Types of Sensors

There are many different types of sensors, each designed to detect a specific kind of information. Below, we will explore some of the most common types of sensors used in programming, AI, and robotics.

## Light Sensors

- **What they do**: Detect the presence or absence of light and its intensity.
- **Example**: A solar panel uses light sensors to determine the amount of sunlight it receives.
- **Where used**: Automatic streetlights, smartphones that adjust screen brightness.

## Temperature Sensors

- **What they do**: Measure temperature (how hot or cold something is).
- **Example**: A thermostat in your home or school that controls the heating or cooling system.
- **Where used**: Air conditioners, refrigerators, weather stations.

## Motion Sensors

- **What they do**: Detect movement.
- **Example**: Motion sensors in security systems that detect if someone is walking near the house.
- **Where used**: Automatic doors, home security systems, and gaming consoles (like Xbox Kinect).

## Sound Sensors (Microphones)

- **What they do**: Detect sound waves or noise levels.
- **Example**: Microphones in phones or voice assistants like Alexa and Siri.
- **Where used**: Music studios, phones, and voice-controlled devices.

## Proximity Sensors

- **What they do**: Detect the presence of objects nearby without touching them.
- **Example**: Parking sensors in cars that beep when you get too close to an obstacle.
- **Where used**: Smartphones (detect when you bring the phone to your ear), robots (for navigation).

## Pressure Sensors

- **What they do**: Measure the amount of force applied to an object.
- **Example**: Pressure sensors in touch screens or car tires that tell you when the air pressure is too low.
- **Where used**: Smart touch devices, elevators (to detect how much weight they are carrying).

## Infrared Sensors

- **What they do**: Detect infrared radiation, which is a type of invisible light often associated with heat.
- **Example**: A TV remote control uses infrared light to send signals to the TV.
- **Where used**: Night-vision cameras, temperature measurement tools, and TV remotes.
