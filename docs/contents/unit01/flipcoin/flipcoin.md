# Programming Project: Coin Flip Simulation

![Coin Flip Simulation](img/CoinFlipSimulation500.gif){align="center" width="600"}

This animation displays a **simulation of 500 coin tosses**. As can be observed, the **percentages of heads and tails** are converging towards **50%**, which is the theoretical probability of getting a head or a tail in a single toss.
