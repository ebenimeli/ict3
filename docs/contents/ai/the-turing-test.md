The Turing test is a way to measure a machine's ability to think and understand like a human. It was proposed by Alan Turing, a famous computer scientist, in 1950. The test works by having a human judge talk to both a human and a machine through a computer screen or other means of communication. If the judge can't tell which one is the machine, then the machine is said to have passed the Turing test and is considered to have human-like intelligence. It's a way to test the intelligence of machines.
