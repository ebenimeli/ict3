# Programming Project: Coin Flip Simulation

![Coin Flip Simulation](images/CoinFlipSimulation500.gif){align="center" width="600"}

This animation displays a **simulation of 500 coin tosses**. As can be observed, the **percentages of heads and tails** are converging towards **50%**, which is the theoretical probability of getting a head or a tail in a single toss.

## 0. Heads or Tails

Obviously, we need coins for this simulation. Coin flipping, coin tossing, or heads or tails is the practice of throwing a coin in the air and checking which side is showing when it lands, in order to choose between two alternatives, heads or tails, sometimes used to resolve a dispute between two parties.

## 1. Definition of variables

![Variables](images/flipcoin_variables.gif){align="center" width="600"}

These are the variables that need to be defined in the simulation application:

**Heads or tails?**

* `result`: This variable stores a **random** integer between 0 and 1, meaning result can have a **value of 0 or 1**. We will assign the value 0 to "heads" and the value 1 to "tails."

**Number of heads and tails**

* `heads`: The variable heads stores the **number of heads** that have appeared so far.
* `tails`: The variable tails stores the **number of tails** that have appeared so far.

**Flips or tosses**

* `flips`: The variable flips stores the number of heads and tails that have appeared so far, in other words, the **number of coin tosses** performed.
* `nflips`: The variable `nflips` stores the **number of tosses** the simulator **will perform**.

**Frequency and percetages**

* `f_heads`: The variable `f_heads` stores the **percentage of heads** that have appeared so far. It is a numerical value.
* `f_tails`: The variable `f_tails` stores the **percentage of tails** that have appeared so far. It is a numerical value.
* `p_heads`: The variable `p_heads` stores the **percentage of heads** that have appeared so far followed by the **"%" character**. It is a text value displayed in the interface.
* `p_tails`: The variable `p_tails` stores the **percentage of tails** that have appeared so far followed by the **"%" character**
* . It is a text value displayed in the interface.

## 2. The Main Loop

The structure of the main program should look like this:

    wait 2 sec
    flips = 0
    heads = 0
    tails = 0
    repeat nflips
        result = random(0,1)
        flips = flips + 1
        wait 0.2 sec
    
In Scratch, you can build this main loop using the following instructions and control structures:
