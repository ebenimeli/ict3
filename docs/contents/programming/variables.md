# Introduction to Python Programming

## What is Python?
Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports various programming paradigms, making it suitable for diverse applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation.

## 1. Variables and Data Types
In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. Variables do not require explicit declarations; you simply assign a value to them.

```python
# Integer variable
age = 25

# Floating-point variable
height = 1.75

# String variable
name = "John Doe"
```

## 2. Declaration and Assignment
- **Declaration:** You don't need to declare the data type explicitly. Python infers it based on the assigned value.
- **Assignment:** Use the `=` operator to assign a value to a variable.

```python
# Integer declaration and assignment
num_of_students = 100

# Floating-point declaration and assignment
pi_value = 3.14

# String declaration and assignment
greeting_message = "Hello, Python!"
```

## 3. Data Types in Python
Python supports various data types, including:

- **int:** Integer (whole numbers)
- **float:** Floating-point (decimal numbers)
- **str:** String (text)

## 4. Printing Values
The `print()` function is used to display values. You can print variables or direct values.

```python
# Printing integer value
print(num_of_students)

# Printing floating-point value
print(pi_value)

# Printing string value
print(greeting_message)
```

## 5. Operations with Variables
You can perform mathematical operations on numeric variables.

```python
# Mathematical operations
result = num_of_students * 2
print(result)

# Combining strings
full_name = name + " Smith"
print(full_name)
```

These fundamental concepts form the basis of Python programming. As you progress, you'll explore more advanced topics and gain the skills to build complex applications.
