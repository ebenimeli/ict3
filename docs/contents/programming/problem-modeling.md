# Interpretation of reality through problem modeling

# Problem modeling

In programming, problem modeling is the process of representing a real-world problem in a way that can be solved by a computer program. This typically involves breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts and identifying the relationships between those parts.

# The interpretation of reality

The interpretation of reality through problem modeling is the process of understanding how the problem to be solved relates to the real-world situation that it is intended to address, and using that understanding to inform the design of the program. This can help ensure that the program correctly captures the relevant aspects of the problem and produces accurate and useful results.
