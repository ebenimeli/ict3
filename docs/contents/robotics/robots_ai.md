# Robots and AI

## Robots and Artificial Intelligence

Robots and artificial intelligence (AI) are closely related, but they are not the same thing. A robot is a machine that can be programmed to perform a variety of tasks, while AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as learning, problem solving, and decision making.

In many cases, robots use AI to make decisions about what actions to take. For example, a robot in a manufacturing plant might use AI to decide which parts to pick up and assemble based on the shape and size of the parts. Similarly, a robot in a healthcare setting might use AI to analyze medical images and make recommendations to doctors.

However, not all robots use AI. Some robots are programmed to perform a specific set of tasks without any decision making capabilities. For example, a robot used to move heavy objects in a warehouse might simply follow a predetermined path and pick up objects along the way.

On the other hand, not all AI is used in robots. AI can be used in many different applications, such as virtual assistants, self-driving cars, and fraud detection systems. These applications do not necessarily involve physical robots.

Overall, the relationship between robots and AI is complex and evolving. As you study robotics and AI, you'll learn more about how these technologies are used together and separately to solve real-world problems.
