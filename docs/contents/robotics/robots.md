## What is a robot?

A robot is a machine that can be programmed to perform a variety of tasks. These tasks can range from simple actions like moving objects from one place to another, to more complex actions like assembling parts or performing surgery. Robots can be designed to operate autonomously or be controlled by a human operator.

What sets robots apart from other machines is their ability to sense their environment and respond to it. They do this through the use of sensors such as cameras, microphones, and touch sensors. Based on the information they receive from these sensors, robots can make decisions about what actions to take.

Robots come in many different shapes and sizes, and can be designed for a variety of purposes. For example, some robots are designed to work in factories, while others are used in healthcare settings to assist with surgeries or help patients with mobility issues. As you study robotics, you'll learn more about the different types of robots and how they are used in various industries.

Overall, robots are an exciting and rapidly developing field in technology, and studying robotics can lead to many interesting career opportunities.
